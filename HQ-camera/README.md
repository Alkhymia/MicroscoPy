# Raspberry Pi High Quality (HQ) camera test

This folder is dedicated to Raspberry Pi's new [HQ camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/). 

The new camera gives a better quality imaging but it is 50% larger thus it requires a larger Lego housing, which challenges the tilting mechanism. The improvement is marginal for many cases because the performance of this microscope is anyway limited by other factors, like the low-cost objective lens. 

Overall, I think it is NOT worth the extra effort and cost unless a completely new microscope architecture with a more stable tilting mechanism and a better quality lens is designed.

Follow these detailed [instructions](Instructions_HQ.pdf) if you would like to try yourself. 

**Note:** Use the modified Python code (**MicroscoPy_HQ.py**) in this folder for the best resolution.
